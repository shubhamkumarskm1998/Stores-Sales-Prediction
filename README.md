# Stores-Sales-Prediiction
# Introduction: 
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. 
Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily 
sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many 
factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, 
seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting 
sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be 
quite varied.
